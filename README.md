Banner designs for the courses on Online Practice that launched between 2014-2017.

A templated design was created for consistent navigation, but still allowing Design freedom. Designers for the course created concepts in Photoshop/Illustrator and then I created them in HTML. The grunt task is set up so that it provides individual CSS files for each course including only the unique values. This way the developer was able to simply copy and paste the CSS into their existing codebase.
